## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0 Brownfield Hardening & Integration (Phases 1-6) - SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

### Phase 1: Cleanup & Config Foundation
**Goal**: Codebase is clean, config system unified, helper sourcing consistent — foundation ready for integration testing
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CLN-01, CLN-02, CLN-03, CLN-04, CLN-05, CFG-01, CFG-02, CFG-03, CFG-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Archive directory removed from main branch (preserved in git history)
  2. Coverage artifacts and LSP tools removed from tracked files
  3. GlobalLabConfig is single source of truth with validation on load
  4. All entry points use consistent helper sourcing pattern (standardized)
  5. Template system reads/writes JSON with schema validation
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md -- Delete .archive/, untrack artifacts, remove dead code
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md -- Standardize helper sourcing with fail-fast error handling
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md -- Unify config to $GlobalLabConfig, add validation, remove legacy vars
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md -- Template JSON validation on read and write

### Phase 2: Security Hardening
**Goal**: Lab deployments use secure defaults with no hardcoded credentials or insecure downloads
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03, SEC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Default passwords removed from config — deployment fails if password not provided via environment variable or parameter
  2. SSH operations use accept-new or known_hosts — never StrictHostKeyChecking=no
  3. All external downloads validate SHA256 checksums before execution
  4. Credentials never appear in plain text in log output or run artifacts
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md -- Credential resolution chain with warning-on-default and interactive fallback (SEC-01)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md -- Replace SSH UserKnownHostsFile=NUL with lab-specific known_hosts (SEC-02)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md -- Mandatory download checksums and credential scrubbing for logs (SEC-03, SEC-04)

### Phase 3: Core Lifecycle Integration
**Goal**: Bootstrap → Deploy → Use → Teardown completes end-to-end on clean Windows host without errors
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: LIFE-01, LIFE-02, LIFE-03, LIFE-04, LIFE-05, CLI-01, CLI-02, CLI-03, CLI-04, CLI-05, CLI-06, CLI-07, CLI-08, CLI-09, NET-01, NET-02, NET-03, NET-04, NET-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Bootstrap action installs prerequisites, creates directories, validates environment without errors
  2. Deploy action provisions VMs with correct hardware specs, network config, and domain join
  3. Quick mode restores LabReady snapshot and auto-heals infrastructure gaps reliably
  4. Teardown removes all lab resources cleanly (VMs, checkpoints, vSwitch, NAT) with no orphans
  5. Re-deploy after teardown succeeds (idempotent infrastructure creation)
  6. Health check reports accurate status with actionable diagnostics
  7. All destructive actions require confirmation tokens before executing
  8. Error handling uses try-catch on critical operations with context-aware messages
  9. Network infrastructure (vSwitch, NAT, static IPs, DNS) configures correctly and validates connectivity
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md -- Fix string interpolation, param syntax, legacy vars in Bootstrap/Deploy/Preflight/Health (LIFE-01, CLI-04)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md -- Add try-catch error handling to all critical Deploy.ps1 sections (CLI-08, LIFE-01)

**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: GUI-01, GUI-02, GUI-03, GUI-04, GUI-05, GUI-06, GUI-07, GUI-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  5. Logs view displays color-coded entries from in-memory log list
  6. View switching works reliably between all views without state corruption
  7. Script-scoped variable closures captured correctly in all event handlers
  8. CLI and GUI achieve feature parity — no capability gaps between interfaces
**Plans**: 4 plans

### 🚧 v1.1 Production Robustness (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Every function handles errors explicitly, the orchestrator is modular and testable, and all 10 known production gaps are closed — so deploys either succeed or explain exactly why they failed.

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (7, 8, 9, 10): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (7.1, 7.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 7: Security & Reliability Fixes** - Close 8 production gaps in security and reliability (S1-S4, R1-R4)
- [ ] **Phase 8: Orchestrator Extraction** - Extract 31 inline functions from OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 to Private/ helpers
- [ ] **Phase 9: Error Handling** - Add try-catch error handling to all 39 functions currently missing it
- [ ] **Phase 10: Module Diagnostics** - Reconcile module exports and replace Out-Null with Write-Verbose

## Phase Details

### Phase 7: Security & Reliability Fixes
**Goal**: All documented security and reliability production gaps (S1-S4, R1-R4) are closed with no hardcoded credentials, insecure SSH operations, unchecked downloads, or incorrect control flow
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03, SEC-04, REL-01, REL-02, REL-03, REL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Initialize-LabVMs.ps1 uses $GlobalLabConfig.Credentials.AdminPassword instead of hardcoded default (S1 closed)
  2. Open-LabTerminal.ps1 uses StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new instead of =no (S2 closed)
  3. Deploy.ps1 validates Git installer SHA256 checksum after download (S3 closed)
  4. New-LabUnattendXml emits Write-Warning about plaintext password storage in unattend.xml (S4 closed)
  5. Test-DCPromotionPrereqs always executes network connectivity check without early return skip (R1 closed)
  6. Ensure-VMsReady uses return instead of exit 0 to avoid premature script termination (R2 closed)
  7. New-LabNAT and Set-VMStaticIP validate IP addresses and CIDR prefix before applying configuration (R3 closed)
  8. Initialize-LabVMs and New-LabSSHKey use $GlobalLabConfig paths instead of hardcoded paths (R4 closed)
**Plans**: TBD

- TBD

### Phase 8: Orchestrator Extraction
**Goal**: OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 orchestrator is modular and testable with all 31 inline functions extracted to Private/ helpers
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: EXT-01, EXT-02, EXT-03, EXT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 31 inline functions moved from OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 to Private/ helpers with proper naming conventions
  2. OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 sources extracted helpers via $OrchestrationHelperPaths array in Lab-Common.ps1
  3. Each extracted helper has [CmdletBinding()], explicit parameters, and no script-scope variable dependencies
  4. All 542 existing Pester tests continue passing after extraction (no behavior regression)
  5. Extracted helpers are independently testable with unit tests
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- TBD

### Phase 9: Error Handling
**Goal**: All 39 functions without try-catch get explicit error handling with context-aware messages
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: ERR-01, ERR-02, ERR-03, ERR-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 28 Private functions without try-catch have explicit error handling added
  2. All 11 Public functions without try-catch have explicit error handling added
  3. Error messages include function name and actionable context (not just stack traces)
  4. No function uses exit to terminate — all use return or throw for proper error propagation
  5. Error handling follows PowerShell best practices (ErrorAction, ErrorRecord, terminating vs non-terminating)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- TBD

### Phase 10: Module Diagnostics
**Goal**: Module export list is accurate and diagnostic visibility is maximized without suppressing useful output
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: DIAG-01, DIAG-02, DIAG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 65 Out-Null instances replaced with Write-Verbose in operational paths (diagnostic visibility)
  2. SimpleLab.psd1 FunctionsToExport matches actual Public/ function count (export reconciliation)
  3. SimpleLab.psm1 Export-ModuleMember matches .psd1 FunctionsToExport list (consistency)
  4. Module loads without warnings about missing or extra exported functions
**Plans**: TBD
