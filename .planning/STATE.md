# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** Every function handles errors explicitly, surfaces clear diagnostics, and the codebase is modular enough that each piece can be tested and maintained independently.
**Current focus:** v1.2 milestone planning

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 13 (Documentation and Onboarding) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 08 of 11
Status: v1.2 milestone active — phase 11 documentation plans executing
Last activity: 2026-02-20 — 11-08 VM lifecycle support help verification complete

Progress: [████████████████████████████████████████] 38/38 plans complete (v1.1), 8/11 phase-11 plans complete in v1.2

## Performance Metrics

**Previous milestone (v1.0):**
- 6 phases, 25 plans, 56 requirements
- Total execution time: 1.3 hours
- Average plan duration: 4.0 min
- 542 Pester tests passing

**Current milestone (v1.1):**
- 4 phases, 19 requirements
- Phases complete: 7:2 plans, 8:4 plans, 9:4 plans, 10:3 plans
- Test count after v1.1: 847 passing

**Current milestone (v1.2):**
- 3 planned phases (11-13), 11 requirements
- Phase 11: 8/11 plans complete (plans 01-08 done)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Extraction before optimization**: isolate inline logic before changing behavior (v1.1)
- **Error propagation discipline**: prefer explicit returns/throws over script exits (v1.1)
- **Export contract source of truth**: Public directory drives export list (v1.1)
- **Delivery readiness first**: docs/CI/tests before new features (v1.2)
- **VM lifecycle help already complete**: All 5 target files (Wait-LabVMReady, Connect-LabVM, New-LabVM, Remove-LabVM, Remove-LabVMs) had complete comment-based help prior to plan 11-08 execution

### Pending Todos

- None — awaiting implementation after roadmap approval

### Blockers/Concerns

- None currently.
