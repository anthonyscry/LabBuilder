# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** Every function handles errors explicitly, surfaces clear diagnostics, and the codebase is modular enough that each piece can be tested and maintained independently.
**Current focus:** v1.2 milestone planning

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 13 (Documentation and Onboarding) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 11 of 11
Status: v1.2 milestone active — phase 11 documentation plans executing
Last activity: 2026-02-20 — 11-07 runtime docs validation script, evidence report, and 22-test Pester contract complete

Progress: [████████████████████████████████████████] 38/38 plans complete (v1.1), 11/11 phase-11 plans complete in v1.2

## Performance Metrics

**Previous milestone (v1.0):**
- 6 phases, 25 plans, 56 requirements
- Total execution time: 1.3 hours
- Average plan duration: 4.0 min
- 542 Pester tests passing

**Current milestone (v1.1):**
- 4 phases, 19 requirements
- Phases complete: 7:2 plans, 8:4 plans, 9:4 plans, 10:3 plans
- Test count after v1.1: 847 passing

**Current milestone (v1.2):**
- 3 planned phases (11-13), 11 requirements
- Phase 11: 11/11 plans complete (all plans done)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Extraction before optimization**: isolate inline logic before changing behavior (v1.1)
- **Error propagation discipline**: prefer explicit returns/throws over script exits (v1.1)
- **Export contract source of truth**: Public directory drives export list (v1.1)
- **Delivery readiness first**: docs/CI/tests before new features (v1.2)
- **VM lifecycle help already complete**: All 5 target files (Wait-LabVMReady, Connect-LabVM, New-LabVM, Remove-LabVM, Remove-LabVMs) had complete comment-based help prior to plan 11-08 execution
- [Phase 11]: No changes required to health/environment check files — all four files already contained complete .SYNOPSIS, .DESCRIPTION, and .EXAMPLE blocks
- [Phase 11-documentation-and-onboarding]: All 7 VM lifecycle files already had complete help blocks — no edits required, verified against .SYNOPSIS/.DESCRIPTION/.PARAMETER/.EXAMPLE tokens
- [Phase 11-documentation-and-onboarding]: Write-LabStatus.ps1 was missing .DESCRIPTION and .EXAMPLE entirely; added both to meet DOC-04 coverage
- [Phase 11-documentation-and-onboarding]: Enhanced thinner example sections in Show-LabStatus, Write-RunArtifact, Save-LabCheckpoint, Restore-LabCheckpoint for practical operator value
- [Phase 11-10]: Reset-Lab.ps1 and Test-LabIso.ps1 already had complete help; four Linux helpers (DHCP, install media, SSH info, VMIPv4) updated with missing .PARAMETER and .EXAMPLE entries
- [Phase 11-01]: README already had all required CLI entry-point tokens; only [Getting Started] cross-link was added; EntryDocs tests use regex anchors for stable drift-resistant coverage
- [Phase 11-04]: New-LabNAT and New-LabSSHKey were missing .PARAMETER docs; all 9 network/domain/provisioning files had .EXAMPLE enhanced with descriptive text and a third operator example
- [Phase 11]: Numbered scenario entries in RUNBOOK-ROLLBACK.md use bare numbered lines to match verify regex
- [Phase 11]: Expected outcome fields documented per workflow in LIFECYCLE-WORKFLOWS.md
- [Phase 11-documentation-and-onboarding]: Empty param() blocks with no declared parameters are exempt from .PARAMETER gate — regex requires [type] or $Param tokens inside param block
- [Phase 11-documentation-and-onboarding]: Test-HyperVEnabled.ps1 correctly excluded from .PARAMETER gate — its param() is empty; updated regex catches only files with declared parameters
- [Phase 11-07]: Runtime validation script always writes report scaffold even in SKIPPED state; Windows API calls wrapped in try/catch for cross-platform safety

### Pending Todos

- None — awaiting implementation after roadmap approval

### Blockers/Concerns

- None currently.
