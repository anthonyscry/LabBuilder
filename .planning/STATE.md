# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** Every function handles errors explicitly, surfaces clear diagnostics, and the codebase is modular enough that each piece can be tested and maintained independently.
**Current focus:** v1.7 Operational Excellence & Analytics - Lab analytics, advanced reporting, operational workflows, and performance guidance

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.7 Operational Excellence & Analytics — IN PROGRESS
Phase: Phase 31 (Advanced Reporting) - Ready to plan
Plan: —
Status: Phase 30 (Lab Analytics) completed, ready for Phase 31 planning
Last activity: 2026-02-21 — Phase 30 execution completed

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░░] 25% (v1.7 Milestone - 4 phases, 14 requirements; Phase 30 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Brownfield Hardening & Integration:** 6 phases, 25 plans, 56 requirements
**v1.1 Production Robustness:** 4 phases, 13 plans, 19 requirements
**v1.2 Delivery Readiness:** 3 phases, 16 plans, 11 requirements
**v1.3 Lab Scenarios & Operator Tooling:** 4 phases, 8 plans, 14 requirements
**v1.4 Configuration Management & Reporting:** 4 phases, 8 plans, 13 requirements
**v1.5 Advanced Scenarios & Multi-OS:** 4 phases, 8 plans, 16 requirements (~226 new tests)
**v1.6 Lab Lifecycle & Security Automation:** 4 phases, 17 plans, 18 requirements (94 new tests)
**v1.7 Operational Excellence & Analytics:** 4 phases, 3 plans, 14 requirements (Phase 30 complete)

**Total: 33 planned phases, 98 plans, 161 requirements across 8 milestones**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Key decisions for v1.6:
- TTL defaults to disabled — operator must opt in to auto-suspend
- STIG defaults to disabled — operator must opt in to DISA baselines
- ADMX Enabled defaults to true, CreateBaselineGPO defaults to false — import runs by default, GPOs are opt-in
- TTL monitoring uses Windows Scheduled Tasks (survives PowerShell session termination), not background jobs
- STIG compliance uses cache-on-write (.planning/stig-compliance.json) — no live DSC queries on dashboard hot path
- Dashboard enrichment uses 60-second background runspace + synchronized hashtable — must be designed at phase start
- DSC modules must install -Scope AllUsers (machine scope) — CurrentUser silently fails under SYSTEM context
- Wait-LabADReady gates ADMX/GPO on Get-ADDomain with 120s timeout, 10s retry interval
- STA apartment state required for WPF runspace compatibility
- PowerSTIG exception uses ValueData='' skip marker pattern
- Per-template error isolation for GPO creation — one failure doesn't block others
- Comma-prefix operator (,@()) prevents single-element array unwrapping in PSCustomObject

### Pending Todos

**v1.7 Execution:**
- ~~Execute Phase 30: Lab Analytics~~ (COMPLETED 2026-02-21)
- Plan Phase 31: Advanced Reporting
- Plan Phase 32: Operational Workflows
- Plan Phase 33: Performance Guidance

### Blockers/Concerns

None
