# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Every button, menu option, and CLI action works reliably from start to finish — bootstrap through teardown, in both GUI and CLI, on a single host or coordinated across multiple hosts.
**Current focus:** MILESTONE COMPLETE — All 6 phases done, 56/56 requirements satisfied

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 6 (Multi-Host Coordination)
Plan: 5 of 5 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-17 — Phase 6 Plan 05 complete (End-to-end integration tests for hardened coordinator pipeline)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 19
- Average duration: 4.0 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Brownfield hardening milestone — 107 functions exist but need integration testing and wiring
- Cleanup dead code and archive — reduce repo noise and search pollution
- Include multi-host coordinator — infrastructure exists, user wants it working
- [Phase 01-cleanup-config-foundation]: Standardized helper sourcing: removed redundant $OrchestrationHelperPaths, added fail-fast error handling
- [Phase 01]: Aggressive dead code removal without reference copies
- [Phase 01-cleanup-config-foundation]: Template validation changed from soft errors to immediate throw with shared validation helper
- [Phase 01]: Killed legacy variables immediately without deprecation period (user decision)
- [Phase 01]: Config validation fails loudly on missing/invalid required fields
- [Phase 02-security-hardening]: Enhanced password resolution with warning-on-default and interactive fallback
- [Phase 02-security-hardening]: Use lab-specific persistent known_hosts file instead of /dev/null for real host key verification
- [Phase 02-security-hardening]: Make Git download checksum validation mandatory (reject if no hash configured)
- [Phase 02-security-hardening]: Use multi-layer credential scrubbing (known defaults, env vars, GlobalLabConfig) with simple string replacement
- [Phase 03-01]: Mandatory subexpression syntax for nested config properties - PowerShell does not interpolate "$GlobalLabConfig.X.Y" correctly without $()
- [Phase 03-01]: Remove all legacy variable fallbacks - Phase 01 migration complete, no need for backward compatibility
- [Phase 03-01]: Pester test enforcement of interpolation rules to prevent regression
- [Phase 03-04]: SSH known_hosts cleanup during teardown to prevent host key errors on redeploy
- [Phase 03-04]: NAT removal verification to catch silent failures
- [Phase 03-04]: Confirmation gates on destructive actions respect Force/NonInteractive flags
- [Phase 03-03]: Fixed systemic invalid parameter syntax across 12 files - PowerShell requires simple parameter names in param blocks, not dotted properties like $GlobalLabConfig.Network.NatName (same issue as 03-01 but in additional files discovered during test execution)
- [Phase 03-05]: Complete legacy variable migration - Invoke-BulkAdditionalVMProvision was last function using $Server_Memory, $Client_Memory, $Server_Processors, $Client_Processors instead of $GlobalLabConfig.VMSizing
- [Phase 03-05]: Subexpression syntax enforcement - Fixed 7 string interpolation bugs, added comprehensive action routing tests to prevent regressions
- [Phase 04-01]: Fixed param syntax in FileServer/Client roles, added prereq validation to DHCP/DSC
- [Phase 04-02]: All 6 core Windows roles get try-catch error handling with post-install service verification
- [Phase 04-03]: DC failure is fatal (aborts build), post-install summary table, 15-role scriptMap in orchestrator
- [Phase 04-04]: Linux roles return safe stubs when config missing, LinuxRoleBase validates before property access
- [Phase 05-01]: Timer lifecycle managed in Switch-View for clean resource cleanup and WPF dispatcher safety
- [Phase 05-02]: Log buffer capped at 2000 entries with FIFO trimming, Application.Current.FindResource for theme-safe color resolution, network settings and admin username persist to both config.json and gui-settings.json
- [Phase 05-03]: Template error display uses inline TextBlock instead of MessageBox, VM names validated client-side, script path unified to OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 for preview and execution consistency
- [Phase 06-01]: Use case-insensitive HashSet for duplicate name detection
- [Phase 06-01]: Default connection to 'local' when missing for safety
- [Phase 06-01]: Normalize connection type to lowercase for consistency
- [Phase 06-02]: Input validation throws immediately on empty/whitespace-only target hosts
- [Phase 06-02]: Config hashtable as third precedence source (parameter > env > config > default)
- [Phase 06-02]: PowerShell parameter binding rejects empty arrays before custom validation runs
- [Phase 06-04]: SSH transient patterns integrated with WinRM patterns in single classifier
- [Phase 06-04]: SSH connection failures (connection refused, no route to host) classified as transient and retried
- [Phase 06-04]: SSH auth failures (host key verification, permission denied) classified as non-transient and not retried
- [Phase 06-05]: OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 creates minimal GlobalLabConfig in test mode (NoExecute or SkipRuntimeBootstrap) to enable integration tests
- [Phase 06-05]: Test mode loads all Private/ helpers to support coordinator pipeline integration tests without manual dependency tracking

### Pending Todos

- Phase 6 COMPLETE (5 plans, 19 integration tests)
- All 6 phases complete — ready for milestone verification

### Blockers/Concerns

**From codebase analysis:**
- Large orchestration scripts (OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 1971 lines, Deploy.ps1 1242 lines) — refactoring blocked until error handling tested
- ~~Dual config system (hashtable + legacy variables)~~ — RESOLVED in 01-03 (migrated to $GlobalLabConfig exclusively)
- ~~Three different helper sourcing patterns~~ — RESOLVED in 01-02 (standardized to Lab-Common.ps1 with fail-fast)
- ~~String interpolation bugs in Deploy.ps1/Bootstrap.ps1~~ — RESOLVED in 03-01 (all nested properties wrapped in subexpressions, Pester test validates)
