# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Every button, menu option, and CLI action works reliably from start to finish — bootstrap through teardown, in both GUI and CLI, on a single host or coordinated across multiple hosts.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Security Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Security Hardening)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In Progress (1 plan remaining: 02-03)
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 02-02 (SSH known_hosts configuration)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 3.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.36 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-cleanup-config-foundation | 4 | 13.1 min | 3.3 min |
| 02-security-hardening | 2 | 8.1 min | 4.0 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-02 (3.6 min), 02-01 (4.5 min), 01-04 (3.9 min), 01-03 (4.0 min), 01-02 (1.2 min)
- Trend: Steady (security hardening and refactoring work)

**Plan Details:**
| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files Changed |
|------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Phase 02-02 | 3.6 min | 2 tasks | 7 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Brownfield hardening milestone — 107 functions exist but need integration testing and wiring
- Cleanup dead code and archive — reduce repo noise and search pollution
- Include multi-host coordinator — infrastructure exists, user wants it working
- [Phase 01-cleanup-config-foundation]: Standardized helper sourcing: removed redundant $OrchestrationHelperPaths, added fail-fast error handling
- [Phase 01]: Aggressive dead code removal without reference copies
- [Phase 01-cleanup-config-foundation]: Template validation changed from soft errors to immediate throw with shared validation helper
- [Phase 01]: Killed legacy variables immediately without deprecation period (user decision)
- [Phase 01]: Config validation fails loudly on missing/invalid required fields
- [Phase 02-security-hardening]: Enhanced password resolution with warning-on-default and interactive fallback
- [Phase 02-security-hardening]: Use lab-specific persistent known_hosts file instead of /dev/null for real host key verification

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From codebase analysis:**
- Large orchestration scripts (OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 1971 lines, Deploy.ps1 1242 lines) — refactoring blocked until error handling tested
- ~~Dual config system (hashtable + legacy variables)~~ — RESOLVED in 01-03 (migrated to $GlobalLabConfig exclusively)
- ~~Three different helper sourcing patterns~~ — RESOLVED in 01-02 (standardized to Lab-Common.ps1 with fail-fast)
