### v1.5 Advanced Scenarios & Multi-OS (Phases 22-25)

**Goal:** Custom role templates, complex networking topologies, and full Linux VM parity for advanced lab scenarios.

#### Phase 22: Custom Role Templates
**Goal:** Operator-defined roles as JSON files that auto-discover and integrate with existing workflows.
**Requirements:** ROLE-01, ROLE-02, ROLE-03, ROLE-04, ROLE-05
**Dependencies:** None (builds on existing LabBuilder/Roles/ pattern)

**Success criteria:**
- JSON role definitions in `.planning/roles/` auto-discovered at runtime
- Custom roles appear in Select-LabRoles UI and CLI
- Validation rejects malformed role templates with clear error messages
- `Get-LabCustomRole -List` shows available custom roles with metadata

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 22-01-PLAN.md — Custom role engine: JSON schema, validator, auto-discovery, listing
- [ ] 22-02-PLAN.md — Integration with Select-LabRoles, Invoke-LabBuilder, Build-LabFromSelection

---

#### Phase 23: Complex Networking
**Goal:** Multi-switch, multi-subnet lab topologies with VLAN support.
**Requirements:** NET-01, NET-02, NET-03, NET-04, NET-05
**Dependencies:** None (extends existing New-LabSwitch/New-LabNAT)

**Success criteria:**
- Lab config supports named switches array (not just single SwitchName)
- VMs reference switches by name in their config
- Inter-subnet routing configurable (gateway VM or host routing)
- VLAN IDs assignable per VM adapter
- Pre-deployment validation catches subnet overlap across switches

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 23-01-PLAN.md — Multi-switch config schema, creation, and subnet conflict validation
- [ ] 23-02-PLAN.md — VM-to-switch assignment, VLAN tagging, and inter-subnet routing

---

#### Phase 24: Linux VM Parity
**Goal:** Full lifecycle parity for Linux VMs including CentOS support.
**Requirements:** LNX-01, LNX-02, LNX-03, LNX-04, LNX-06
**Dependencies:** None (extends existing LinuxRoleBase.ps1)

**Success criteria:**
- Linux VMs support snapshot create/restore/prune same as Windows
- Linux VM settings preserved in configuration profiles
- CentOS/RHEL provisioning via cloud-init or kickstart
- SSH role application has configurable retry count and timeout
- All existing Linux roles work on both Ubuntu and CentOS

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 24-01-PLAN.md — Linux VM snapshot/profile parity (inventory, pruning, profile round-trip)
- [ ] 24-02-PLAN.md — SSH retry with configurable count and CentOS role support

---

#### Phase 25: Mixed OS Integration
**Goal:** End-to-end mixed OS scenarios validated and scenario templates updated.
**Requirements:** LNX-05
**Dependencies:** Phase 22 (custom roles), Phase 23 (networking), Phase 24 (Linux parity)

**Success criteria:**
- Mixed Windows/Linux scenario template works end-to-end (DC + Linux app servers)
- Scenario templates updated to leverage multi-switch and custom role capabilities
- Integration tests cover cross-OS provisioning, networking, and teardown
- Documentation updated for mixed OS lab workflows

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 25-01-PLAN.md — Mixed OS scenario template, updated templates with switch fields, Linux disk estimation
- [ ] 25-02-PLAN.md — Integration tests for cross-OS provisioning and mixed OS documentation
