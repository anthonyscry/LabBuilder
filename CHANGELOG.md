## v1.8.0 - Fix LIN1 Ubuntu 24.04 Install Hang & WS1 RSAT Access Denied

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix LIN1 Ubuntu 24.04 installation hang**: AutomatedLab does not support Ubuntu 24.04 (missing OS definition in `OperatingSystem.cs` and generates cloud-init YAML without the `autoinstall:` directive). The Subiquity installer drops to an interactive wizard and hangs forever. LIN1 is now created manually using native Hyper-V cmdlets with a CIDATA seed disk instead of going through AutomatedLab.
- **Fix WS1 RSAT "Access is denied" COMException**: Domain-joined Win11 inherits Group Policy that redirects Windows Update through DC1, but DC1 doesn't run WSUS. `Add-WindowsCapability` for RSAT features fails with a COMException. Deploy now temporarily bypasses WSUS (`UseWUServer = 0`) during RSAT install and restores the original value afterward. RSAT failure is now non-fatal — deployment logs a warning and continues.

### Changes
- Added `Get-Sha512PasswordHash` function to `Lab-Common.ps1` — generates SHA-512 crypt password hashes for Ubuntu autoinstall identity section (tries OpenSSL first, falls back to .NET crypto).
- Added `New-CidataVhdx` function to `Lab-Common.ps1` — creates a 64 MB FAT32-formatted VHDX with volume label `CIDATA` containing proper `user-data` (with `autoinstall:` directive) and `meta-data` files. Uses VHDX instead of ISO to avoid requiring `oscdimg.exe` or other external tools.
- Added `New-LIN1VM` function to `Lab-Common.ps1` — creates a Gen2 Hyper-V VM with Secure Boot disabled, attaches the Ubuntu ISO as DVD and the CIDATA VHDX as a second SCSI disk, and sets boot order to DVD-first.
- `Deploy.ps1` now creates LIN1 manually (outside AutomatedLab) after DHCP is configured on DC1, when `-IncludeLIN1` is specified. Calls `Remove-HyperVVMStale`, `Get-Sha512PasswordHash`, `New-CidataVhdx`, `New-LIN1VM`, then `Start-VM` before entering the existing SSH wait loop.
- RSAT install scriptblock in `Deploy.ps1` now saves/restores `UseWUServer` registry value and restarts `wuauserv` around `Add-WindowsCapability` calls. Wrapped at host level in try/catch so RSAT failure is non-fatal.

## v1.7.2 - Add Numbered End-to-End Run Order

### Changes
- Added a clearly numbered run sequence to `README.md` covering blow-away, core setup, health checks, optional LIN1 inclusion, and post-deploy LIN1 SSH config.

## v1.7.1 - One-Click LIN1 SSH Post-Deploy Configuration

### Changes
- Added `Configure-LIN1.ps1` for post-deploy LIN1 SSH bootstrap/config when core lab is already up.
- Added new app action/menu entry `lin1-config` / `[L] Configure LIN1 SSH (post-deploy)` in `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1`.

## v1.7.0 - Defer LIN1 by Default to Avoid AutomatedLab Linux Timeout

### Changes
- Added `-IncludeLIN1` switch to `Deploy.ps1`.
- Default deploy path now provisions only `DC1` and `WS1`, deferring LIN1 to avoid 15-minute AutomatedLab Linux timeout on internal switches.
- LIN1 wait/post-config/summary now run only when `-IncludeLIN1` is used and LIN1 is SSH-reachable.

## v1.6.5 - Stronger Phantom LIN1 Recovery (Service Order + Reboot Guidance)

### Changes
- Blow-away now closes stale Hyper-V UI processes (`mmc`, `vmconnect`) and performs ordered Hyper-V service restart (`vmcompute` then `vmms`, then start).
- Added post-refresh LIN1 verification and explicit host reboot guidance when Hyper-V Manager still shows phantom entries despite `Get-VM` object-not-found.
- Updated README troubleshooting steps to match the stronger recovery sequence.

## v1.6.4 - Auto-Refresh Hyper-V Services After Blow-Away

### Changes
- Updated blow-away flow to restart Hyper-V management services (`vmms` and `vmcompute`) when no lab VMs remain, reducing phantom LIN1 UI entries.
- Expanded README phantom-LIN1 troubleshooting with stronger verification and UI refresh steps.

## v1.6.3 - Add Phantom VM Guidance for Hyper-V Manager

### Changes
- Updated blow-away output in `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1` to report when no lab VMs remain and to explain stale Hyper-V Manager cache behavior.
- Added README troubleshooting guidance for phantom `LIN1` entries when `Get-VM`/`Remove-VM` report object not found.

## v1.6.2 - Clear Saved-Critical VM State During Cleanup

### Bug Fixes
- Updated stuck-VM cleanup helpers in `Deploy.ps1` and `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1` to explicitly clear saved VM state (`Remove-VMSavedState`) before stop/remove attempts.
- This handles Hyper-V `Saved-Critical` LIN1 states that block normal stop/remove operations in UI and scripts.

## v1.6.1 - Handle Stuck LIN1 VM State During Cleanup

### Bug Fixes
- Added `Remove-HyperVVMStale` in `Deploy.ps1` with retries, snapshot cleanup, DVD removal, and vmwp process kill fallback for stuck VMs.
- Updated both deploy cleanup guards to use the shared hardened VM-removal function.
- Added `Remove-VMHardSafe` in `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1` so blow-away can remove stuck VMs (including LIN1) more reliably.

## v1.6.0 - Add Pre-Install LIN1 Collision Guard

### Bug Fixes
- Added a second stale-VM cleanup guard immediately before `Install-Lab` in `Deploy.ps1`.
- Prevents late `LIN1 already exists` / malformed LIN1 notes XML failures by verifying no lab VM names remain before AutomatedLab VM creation starts.

## v1.5.9 - Enforce Stale VM Removal Before Install

### Bug Fixes
- Strengthened stale VM cleanup in `Deploy.ps1` to remove checkpoints, stop VMs, remove VMs, and verify deletion before continuing.
- Deployment now fails fast with a clear message if a stale VM (for example `LIN1`) cannot be removed, preventing later AutomatedLab `does already exist` and notes-XML errors.

## v1.5.8 - Remove Stale VMs Before Install-Lab

### Bug Fixes
- Added pre-definition stale VM cleanup in `Deploy.ps1` for `DC1`, `WS1`, and `LIN1`.
- Prevents `Install-Lab` from failing or warning with `The machine 'LIN1' does already exist` after partial/failed teardown cycles.

## v1.5.7 - Quiet Benign Remove-Lab Metadata Errors During Blow-Away

### Bug Fixes
- Updated `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1` blow-away flow to suppress noisy non-terminating `Remove-Lab` error output for already-missing metadata files.
- Teardown behavior remains unchanged: cleanup still continues through VM/file/network removal steps.

## v1.5.6 - Fix "Lab is already exported" During LIN1 Stage

### Bug Fixes
- Removed late LIN1 machine-definition step in `Deploy.ps1` that attempted to call `Add-LabMachineDefinition` after `Install-Lab` export.
- Restored single machine-definition phase for `DC1`, `WS1`, and `LIN1` before `Install-Lab`, preventing export-state failures.
- Kept post-install LIN1 SSH readiness wait and DC1 OpenSSH non-blocking hardening in place.

## v1.5.5 - Do Not Fail Deploy on DC1 OpenSSH Capability Errors

### Bug Fixes
- Hardened DC1 OpenSSH setup in `Deploy.ps1` so capability install/configuration failures no longer abort the entire deployment.
- Deployment now logs a warning and continues when OpenSSH optional feature install fails (for example, DISM `Access is denied`).
- Host key bootstrap to DC1 is now conditional and runs only when OpenSSH is confirmed ready.

## v1.5.4 - Remove Empty-Password Blocker

### Changes
- Updated `Deploy.ps1` to stop throwing when `-AdminPassword` is passed as empty.
- If password input resolves empty after overrides, deployment now falls back to `Server123!` and continues with a warning.

## v1.5.3 - Default Deploy Password for Non-Interactive Runs

### Changes
- Set `Deploy.ps1` default `-AdminPassword` value to `Server123!` so deployment can run without interactive password entry.
- Kept environment/parameter overrides (`OPENCODELAB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `-AdminPassword`) for customization.
- Updated README setup notes to reflect the new default password behavior.

## v1.5.2 - Restore Fully Unattended LIN1 Install Flow

### Bug Fixes
- Reworked deployment order in `Deploy.ps1` so stage 1 installs only `DC1` and `WS1`.
- DHCP is now configured on `DC1` before `LIN1` is defined/installed, so Ubuntu autoinstall is no longer started on an internal switch without DHCP.
- Added a dedicated LIN1 stage: define LIN1, run `Install-Lab` again for the pending Linux machine, then explicitly wait for SSH readiness.

## v1.5.1 - LIN1 Reachability Wait Hardened

### Bug Fixes
- Increased LIN1 readiness wait window from 30 to 75 minutes in `Deploy.ps1` to better accommodate fully unattended Ubuntu installs on slower hosts.
- LIN1 readiness now requires both ICMP reachability and SSH (TCP/22) before post-install Linux configuration begins.
- Wait-loop progress logging now distinguishes between "no DHCP/IP yet" and "IP present but services not ready" to make unattended progress clearer.

## v1.5.0 - Fix DC1 AD DS Promotion Failure & Recovery

### Bug Fixes
- **Add AD DS validation after Install-Lab**: After `Install-Lab` completes (or fails), the
  script now verifies that AD DS is actually operational on DC1 by checking the NTDS service,
  domain membership, and AD cmdlet availability. Previously, only network connectivity (ping
  and WinRM) was validated, so a silently failed DC promotion would go undetected.
- **Add AD DS recovery logic**: If validation detects that DC1 was not promoted (e.g.
  `Install-ADDSForest` failed silently), the script now attempts automatic recovery:
  1. Installs the AD-Domain-Services feature if missing
  2. Runs `Install-ADDSForest` manually with the correct domain parameters
  3. Waits for DC1 to restart and AD Web Services to initialize
  4. Re-validates that the forest is operational
- **Wrap Install-Lab in try/catch**: `Install-Lab` timeout errors are now caught gracefully
  instead of aborting the entire deployment, allowing the recovery logic to attempt a fix.
- **Create LIN1 via Hyper-V instead of Install-Lab**: AutomatedLab's Ubuntu 24.04 autoinstall
  does not work on Internal switches (drops to interactive language selection). LIN1 is now
  removed from `Install-Lab` and created directly via Hyper-V cmdlets (Gen2 VM, DVD boot from
  Ubuntu ISO, Secure Boot off). The user completes the Ubuntu install interactively in the VM
  console. A wait loop (45 min) monitors for LIN1 to get a DHCP address and become pingable
  before proceeding to automated post-install configuration (SSH, netplan, SMB, packages).

## v1.4.1 - Increase AD Readiness Timeout for Slow Hosts

### Bug Fixes
- Increased `AL_Timeout_AdwsReady` from 45 to 120 minutes in `Lab-Config.ps1`.
- This addresses deployments where AD DS promotion completes, but AutomatedLab times out waiting for AD readiness on `DC1` on slower or heavily loaded hosts.
- `Deploy.ps1` already applies this value through `Set-PSFConfig -Name Timeout_DcPromotionAdwsReady`.

## v1.4.0 - Network Validation & Error Propagation Fixes

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix `Get-VM` PowerCLI conflict**: Module-qualified `Get-VM` → `Hyper-V\Get-VM` in
  `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1` post-deploy VM check. Machines with VMware PowerCLI installed
  would silently use the wrong `Get-VM` cmdlet, always reporting VMs as missing.
- **Add Stage 1 network connectivity validation** in `Deploy.ps1`: After `Install-Lab`
  creates DC1, the script now verifies before proceeding to Stage 2:
  1. Host adapter (`vEthernet (OpenCodeLabSwitch)`) still has 192.168.11.1 assigned
  2. NAT rule still exists
  3. DC1 (192.168.11.3) responds to ping
  4. WinRM port 5985 is reachable on DC1 (with 60s retry)
  - If the host IP or NAT were removed by `Install-Lab`, they are automatically re-applied
  - If DC1 is unreachable, deployment aborts with a clear error instead of waiting 80+ min
- **Fix error propagation in `Deploy.ps1`**: The outer `catch` block now re-throws after
  logging, so `Bootstrap.ps1` (and `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1`) correctly detect deployment
  failure instead of reporting "ok"

## v1.3.0 - Fix DC Promotion Timeout on Resource-Constrained Hosts

### Bug Fix
- Fixed deployment failure: "Timeout occurred waiting for Active Directory to be ready on Domain Controller: DC1"
- AutomatedLab default ADWS timeout (20 min) was too short for smaller hosts
- Added configurable timeout overrides in `Lab-Config.ps1`:
  - `AL_Timeout_DcRestart` = 90 min (was 60)
  - `AL_Timeout_AdwsReady` = 45 min (was 20) -- **root cause**
  - `AL_Timeout_StartVM` = 90 min (was 60)
  - `AL_Timeout_WaitVM` = 90 min (was 60)
- `Deploy.ps1` now applies `Set-PSFConfig` overrides before `Install-Lab`

## v1.2.0 - Compatibility Hardening

- Replaced all `<# ... #>` block comments with `#` line comments across all 15 scripts
- Stripped UTF-8 BOMs from Lab-Common, Start-LabDay, Test-OnWS1
- Removed unicode/non-ASCII characters from Deploy.ps1 and Bootstrap.ps1
- Removed redundant `#Requires -Modules AutomatedLab` from Deploy.ps1
- All scripts now extract cleanly from GitHub release zips without parser errors

- Added VM existence guard after bootstrap

### Simplification Refactor
- Renamed all scripts from verbose `_POLISHED_FINAL` / `_REBUILDABLE` suffixes to clean names
- Deleted superseded `Lab-Menu_POLISHED_FINAL.ps1` (replaced by `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1`)
- Added `Invoke-BashOnLIN1` helper to `Lab-Common.ps1` (copy `.sh` + remote execute pattern)
- Added `Ensure-VMsReady` helper to `Lab-Common.ps1`

- Simplified `Resolve-ScriptPath` in orchestrator (direct join, no glob)
- Updated all internal cross-references to new filenames
- Updated README and docs

## v1.2.0 - Parameter Audit & Documentation

### AutomatedLab Parameter Audit
- Audited all 15 cmdlets against AutomatedLab source (commit 869e498b890682640a1d2b0b514756509d9844b7)
- **Result:** All cmdlet parameters in codebase are CORRECT
- Install-Lab correctly called without -Machines parameter (installs all defined machines)

### Documentation Updates
- Updated README with cmdlet parameter reference
- Added parameter validation examples to comments

## v1.0.0 - Automation Hardening Release

- Added `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1` as the single orchestrator entry point.
- Added one-button setup/reset workflows and desktop shortcut installer.
- Added strict preflight (`Test-OpenCodeLabPreflight.ps1`) and health gate (`Test-OpenCodeLabHealth.ps1`).
- Added automatic rollback attempt to `LabReady` when post-deploy health fails.
- Added noninteractive support across setup and daily workflow scripts.
- Standardized SSH key path usage to `C:\LabSources\SSHKeys\id_ed25519`.
- Hardened deploy secret handling: admin password now required via env var or parameter.
- Replaced plaintext SMB password-in-fstab with a protected credentials file on LIN1.
- Added machine-readable run artifacts (`json` + `txt`) with retention support.
- Added destructive action dry-run support.

## Breaking/Operational Notes

- `Deploy.ps1` now requires `-AdminPassword` or `OPENCODELAB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- `OpenCodeLab-App.ps1 -Action menu` is interactive-only; automation should use explicit actions.
